Utilizing the OpenWeather API, the application pulls up to date information, which is then projected into a smooth user experience via the linked Javascript. The data that is displayed is set into a convenient 5 day forecast to offer optimal long term weather speculation.


Search history for this application is stored in local storage, and is fully selectable within an appended list, under the search function. This list will show all the prior searches that you have made, making for easy identification of favorite locations. Included within this data is location name, the current date, the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius, the humidity rating, the wind speed, the UV rating along with a colored icon that will change depending on the severity of the UV range, and a forecast for the next five days.
